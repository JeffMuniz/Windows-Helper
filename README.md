# LineEndings
help deal crlf and lf-This is a Windows Repo


More specifically, the text=auto option tells Git to only normalize line endings to LF for text files while leaving binary files (images, fonts, etc.) untouched. This distinction is important—we don’t want to corrupt binary files by modifying their line endings.

One final note: In the recommended .gitattributes file, we used * text=auto to mark all text files for end-of-line normalization to LF once they’re staged in Git’s index. We could’ve also done * text=auto eol=lf, although these two are not identical. Like I mentioned before, if you only use * text=auto, you may still see some CRLF line endings locally in your working tree; this is okay and is working as expected. If you don’t want this, you can enforce * text=auto eol=lf instead. However, this is usually not necessary because the main concern is about what line endings make it into the index and your repo.



Summary: Git Config vs. .gitattributes
There are some similarities between Git’s local settings and the Git attributes we looked at. The table below lists each Git setting, its corresponding .gitattributes rule, and the line endings for text files in the index and working tree:

Git config          	.gitattributes      	Index/Repo	Working Tree
core.autocrlf=true  	* text=auto eol=crlf        	LF	CRLF
core.autocrlf=input	    * text=auto	                    LF	original (LF or CRLF)

Via .gitattributes:
# Keep these file types as CRLF (Windows). These are explicitly windows files and should use crlf
*.bat    text eol=crlf
*.cmd    text eol=crlf
*.ps1    text eol=crlf
*.exe
* text=autocrlf 

Default from github file
# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
* text=auto

About .gitignore:
  1: [core] autocrlf = false [filter "lfs"] required = true clean = git-lfs clean -- %f smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f process = git-lfs filter-process


$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
# Configure Git to ensure line endings in files you checkout are correct for Windows.
# For compatibility, line endings are converted to Unix style when you commit files.
